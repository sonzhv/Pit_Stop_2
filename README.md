Second assignment for Digital Literary Studies made by Sofiia Zheliapova.

I selected the short story _“The Tell-Tale Heart”_ by Edgar Allan Poe from the book _The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, in One Volume: Complete Tales and Poems_. I found the PDF on Internet Archive (https://archive.org/details/completestoriep00poee)  and uploaded it to Google Docs, where I extracted the text. I then manually cleaned the text, carefully removing hyphens at line breaks, page numbers, and any strange or unnecessary characters, in order to ensure that the text was suitable for both close reading and digital analysis.

From the **qualitative analysis**, or close reading, I gained a deeper understanding of how to identify and interpret the narrative voice, as well as how to evaluate the reliability of the narrator. I learned how to analyze central themes, literary style, and the structure of the story. 

From the **quantitative analysis**, I learned how to examine the text using counts, measurements, and pattern recognition. Working with VoyantTools, I explored the text from a new perspective, moving beyond individual interpretation to uncover patterns that might not be immediately visible through reading alone. For example, I could track word frequencies, repeated motifs, and stylistic tendencies, which helped me see how Poe’s language contributes to the story’s tension, rhythm, and psychological impact. 

Ultimately, I learned that **qualitative and quantitative methods are not opposites, but rather complementary tools** in literary analysis. Close reading allows for deep interpretive insight, while digital tools and quantitative approaches enable pattern recognition and broader structural observations.
